# SDCC 8080 port

**WARNING WARNING WARNING: DO NOT USE THIS REPOSITORY FOR OBTAINING SDCC**

This is a repository containing experimental modifications to SDCC to generate 8080 code and provided for [project](https://hackaday.io/project/166827-targeting-sdcc-to-the-8080) participants only. It is work in progress. Nothing is guaranteed to work. It uses the same build procedures as the SDCC source distribution so consult that. Issue reports for any part of the software other than the 8080 code generator will be ignored.

If you want official SDCC sources, see the [subversion repository for SDCC at Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/p/sdcc/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/sdcc/). If you just want binary packages visit [the SDCC Sourceforge site](http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/).
